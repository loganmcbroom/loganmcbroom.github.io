This directory attempts to document the large number of cryptographic techniques applied to the eyes. Much of this information is thanks to codewarrior0, whos [Analytical Overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QeagH8TklJsd8iribMtT5LIRL91laOUU_tFcVl7OOqA/edit) contains the results of many standard tests. Unless otherwise noted, all techniques in this directory assume the standard [trigram reading](https://loganmcbroom.github.io/docs/Cryptography/Trigrams.html) of the eyes. Rather than transcribing that document here in its entirety, it is distributed within appropriate subsections along with other work done on each topic.
