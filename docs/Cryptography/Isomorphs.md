The eye messages contain a set of patterns called isomorphs, originally found and [documented](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12sCi3OrTuy4PPcu3zUykue7suHvAPyK-uFKcm8Rp4Go/edit) by Lymm. 

TODO there should probably be a subpage for Lymms doc and another for the cw0 [list document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a4uOf7SkXEPCROEi1iHzU5Lbr3zMbtOqSq_J5c4kyOw/edit#)

[This](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaeWuA9AJLRZOBVm5cr0Ucz3ezK6tbrm0PK0qdnsBok) gonzo doc might also fit in here?
