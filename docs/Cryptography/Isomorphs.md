The eye messages contain a set of patterns called isomorphs. Originally found and [documented](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12sCi3OrTuy4PPcu3zUykue7suHvAPyK-uFKcm8Rp4Go/edit) by Lymm. That document is transcribed below. Other research involving these patterns can be found in the subdirectories.

### Eye Message Alignments and Gap Patterns

TODO: this document is important enough to transcribe but contains a lot of colored text. We could try using html but that will be a mess. The text could be copied in for searching purposes but without highlighting? That makes it somewhat useless. It might be best to just add a lot of tags and stick to a link.
