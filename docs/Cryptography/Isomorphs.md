The eye messages contain a set of patterns called isomorphs, originally found by Lymm.

Lymm's original document [Eye Message Alignments and Gap Patterns](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12sCi3OrTuy4PPcu3zUykue7suHvAPyK-uFKcm8Rp4Go/edit).

[Isomorphism in Classical Ciphers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a4uOf7SkXEPCROEi1iHzU5Lbr3zMbtOqSq_J5c4kyOw/edit#) by codewarrior0 covers what classical cyphers produce isomorphs and how.

[This document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaeWuA9AJLRZOBVm5cr0Ucz3ezK6tbrm0PK0qdnsBok) by gonzo contains some related (are they?) computations on distances between trigrams within seperate messages.
