The cauldron room is the other unsolved puzzle of Noita. A developer commented when asked about this puzzle, "I wouldn't spend too much time with the cauldron puzzle", so it doesn't have the same level of active research that the eyes do. Regardless, some believe the solution to the eyes may have something to do with the cauldron, so it is documented here. The info on this page was transcribed from the following documents:

TODO transcribe? probably don't need to tbh, it's the cauldron.
