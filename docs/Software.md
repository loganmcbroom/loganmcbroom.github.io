Many programs accross many languages have been written to process and analyze the eyes. In the case of short, single file programs, they may be stored here in their entirety. Larger programs should be tagged with information about their capabilities along with a link to the program in some form. Programs listed do not have to be written specifically for analyzing the eye puzzle, for example general cryptography tools are included. Thanks to defektu for compiling most of these in [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oSY46-WCmytHvI-BtD0X2UkGX6jg9DFJ9oeFGsMKd1g/edit).

### Community Created Tools

- [NoitaEyeCipherTools](https://github.com/greystorm101/NoitaEyeCipherTools) by Joanie in Jupyter Notebook. Tools to analyse and visualise the statistical data.
- [Noita Eye Glyphs Cipher Bruteforcer]() by Azertinv in Rust. Aims to find the cipher of the eye glyphs using a search base fuzzer.
- [SearchWangTiles](https://gist.github.com/vexx32/cfa23f44edfe4f29ffdcc4c8a77ccbfe) by ðŸŒ¸RainðŸŒ¸ in Powershell. Searches Noita's terrain generation wang tiles for a specific pixel color.
- [Toboter Scripts]() - TODO, discord links
- [CheatEngine Tools]() - TODO, discord links
- [Pypeline](https://github.com/turing-system/pipeline) by Dykoine in Python. Allows general multithreaded processing of datasets.
- [Analytic Overview Companion Code](https://github.com/codewarrior0/noita-eye-glyph-analyses) by codewarrior0 in Python. Contains companion source code for the [Analytic Overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QeagH8TklJsd8iribMtT5LIRL91laOUU_tFcVl7OOqA/edit) document.
