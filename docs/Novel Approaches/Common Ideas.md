There are a small set of ideas that periodically reappear when new eye puzzlers start thinking about the puzzle. Those ideas are collected here, not to discourage you from applying them, but to make sure you are aware that they have been tried many times to no effect. Once you are well versed in these theories, consider taking a [bingo card](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LHMM4C2ij4dx9lyw7N4-f0or0rXubvnWfL_GETs6bqM/edit) (courtesy of Lymm) and keep track of the ones you spot in the noita discord!

### The eyes are a konami code
There is no way to systematically prove this is wrong, but it has been tried many times, and does not explain any of the obvious cryptographic clues in the messages.

### It's a magic eye puzzle
We have all tried it at least once. There isn't any serious documentation on this idea, so it is open to testing.

### The earthquake spell has a hint
This has been researched quite a lot! Information can be found [here](https://loganmcbroom.github.io/docs/Connected%20Puzzles/Earthquake%20Spell.html).
