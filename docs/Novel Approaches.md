This directory is for cataloging any research that does not treat the eyes as a pure cryptographic puzzle. Many common, heavily tested ideas can be found in the [Common Ideas](https://loganmcbroom.github.io/docs/Novel%20Approaches/Common%20Ideas.html) document.

TEMP dump spot for tested in game ideas, a lot of this is from the toboter doc but without real references. Might need a page just for dumping all the random silliness that's been tried without documentation.

- Drawing lines in the directions of the eyes, read row-wise, column-wise and in trigram order, ignoring front-facing ones (User: Toboter; Result: Random patterns, tending up-right, small clustered areas with longer stretched of lines)
- Drawing lines, having the line drawer turn in the direction the eyes are facing (relative to its current direction) (User: Toboter, Result: Failure)
- Decoding the eyes using stereographic ciphers (User: Nemare, Result: Failure)
- Colouring eyes depending on the direction they look (User: Arnaud les Biscotos, Einar A; Result: Failure)
- Submerging the Eyes in most common liquids (User: FuryForged, Result: Failure)
- Interpreting the eyes as Kantele notes (either by In-Game order or pitch), and playing them as music (outside the game) (User: Fryke, Result: Random noises)
- Interpreting the sum of the eye indices in each trigram as musical notes (User: Fryke, Result: Random noise)
